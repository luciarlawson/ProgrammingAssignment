# ProgrammingAssignment
RPG Adventure Builder

- How to Use the Game: 
    The aim of the game is to defeat all three enemies before they defeat you. You start with your bare hands and have to build up your inventory with stronger weapons and craft items. You can equip diferent weapons or drink potions throughout the game using the menu. You can also craft at any point and you will be shown a list of craftable items. You can then decide what to craft or decide to close the craft menu.

- Task Approach Summary: 
    Combat enhancements 
        To enhance the overall compat of the game I have impelented three diferent enemies that players will be fighting. There is a zombie, troll and goblin. The zombie is the easyiest to defeat and with drop items that are common or there is a 1 in 4 chance that it drops some slihgtly rarer items. The troll is harder to defeat and can drop rare items however there is a 1 in 8 chance of very rare items. The goblin is the hardest to defeat. It has the moset hp and there is a chance that is doges your attack. This adds randomness to the combat. If you decide to craft a shild this also adds another elemt of randomness to combat
    Item Stats and Loot
        All weapons have a different amount of damage thay can inflict demending on how early on you can craft them or how rare they are. At the start of the game if you choose not to craft you automaticaly recive "Bare Hands". Bare hands only to 5 damage so you are beeter off trying to craft. All the potions craftable if you have the corect "ingredients" in your craft inventory. These are comsumable throughout combat and effect how well you perform against enemies.
    Enemy Drops
        All the enemys drop item if you defeat them. There are a couple basic craft items that you recieve automaticaly as a reward. Then there are better/rarer items that are part of the enemy drop. These can be craft items or weapons. The player has the option to inspect, accept or decline the items.

- New Features: 
    Enemy types
        There are three different enemies all with different stats and behaviours. They all have enemy drops. Drop items depend on item rarity so you are more likely to get a common item. The enmey can drop weapons or crafting items.
    Weapon types
        There are several different weapons you can craft or win throughout the game. These all have different damage rates and some are more common that others. There are throwing knives, swords and a club that you can aquire thoughout the game.
    Defensive items
        This category includes shields and potions. The potions can be consumed during combat to help the player. Health potion - Increases the players health by 20hp. Block potion - Blocks the enemies attack (similar to the shield). Double damage potion - Inceases the damage that is done to the enemy.

- Challanges and solutions:  
    Not having enough time
        The main problem I had when designing this game was not having enough time. I started the assignment too late and had to rush through it rather than enjoy the process. Luckly this is an easy fix for the future. I am normaly a very organised person when it comes to starting things and giving myself enough time. If I was to do this assignment again with more time I would have implemented more enemies to fight and introduced more randomness to the game. I would have also made comprehensive tests for all the major systems as well has designing the save/load functionality. 

    No prior game knowledge
        This was also a major issue when I was designing this game. I have never played video games before. I had to look up what RPG ment.I spent a long time working out what, for exaple, a crafting sytem is. I had no idea what a drop system was either. I think this has negativley effected my game just in terms of how the game is played. When the player has a shield equipped they where originaly asked if they wanted to try and defend or take the damage. I had a few friends test the game and they all agreed that this wasn't really how a game should work. I have now changed it so if the player has a shield equipped it automaticaly defends an attack. There are probably other things in my game that aren't "proper" when it comes to video games. I think if I had more knowledge I would have a better idea of what the end result is supposed to resemble.

    Crafting system
        One of the problems I encountered with the crafting system was displaying it cleanly in a way that doesn't overwhelm players. I think I have succeeded with this part of the problem by displaying the craftable items one after another and what you need to make them underneath. The next part of the promlem was how many options there should be and making sure that the players are able to aquire all the ingredients at some point in the game. Because of the random chance of enemy drops some players will be able to craft items that other players will not.
